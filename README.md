# Zed-ziggy

[Ziggy](https://github.com/kristoff-it/ziggy) extension for [Zed](https://zed.dev).

Provides syntax highlighting and outlines for Ziggy documents and Ziggy schemas.

LSP support is there, but needs a suited distribution of Ziggy. I may come up with a fork to support
that in the meantime.

Note:
Tree-sitter grammars have been extracted from [kristoff-it/ziggy](https://github.com/kristoff-it/ziggy) into their own repositories to work with this extension.
See [lvignoli/tree-sitter-ziggy](https://github.com/lvignoli/tree-sitter-ziggy) and [lvignoli/tree-sitter-ziggy-schema](https://github.com/lvignoli/tree-sitter-ziggy-schema).
